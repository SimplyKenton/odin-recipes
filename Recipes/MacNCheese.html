<h2>My Reason on why I Love Macaroni and Cheese</h2>
<p>Macaorni and Cheese is a staple in the african american community. Being black myself I loved homecook mac n cheese and could eat it all day until I became lactose intolerant</p>
<p>Their are different ways to make macroni and cheese just like there is a different way to make everything else. I am going to provide the way to cook it the way we did in our culture</p>
