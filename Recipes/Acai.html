<h2>Healthy and Sweet Snack</h2>
<p>Acai bowl gives me the same feeling as when I eat ice cream but acai is healtheir. Acai is a type of berry which is blended with usualy mixed with granola after.
    If you ever want sometihng sweet after a long walk in the sun make sure to have these ingredients at home! </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (100g) packet unsweetened frozen acai berry blend, I like the unsweetened version from Sambazon. Trader Joe’s also carries unsweetened acai.</li>
    <li>1 banana, frozen</li>
    <li>¼ to ½ cup non-dairy milk or yogurt</li>
    <li>Fresh berries, granola, peanut butter, to top</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a high-powered blender, combine the acai berry packet, frozen banana, and ¼ cup dairy-free milk of choice.</li>
    <li>Blend until completely smooth, adding more dairy-free milk if necessary until your smoothie will blend smoothly. I recommend using the tamper, if your blender has one, to help the mixture blend smoothly.</li>
    <li>Pour into a bowl and top with your favorite toppings. Enjoy immediately!</li>
